How It Works

#Start Test:

Click Start Test to begin.
The app displays a random sentence and enables the input field.
The timer starts counting down.

#Typing:

As the user types, the app calculates typed characters and checks for accuracy.
If the user finishes typing the entire text before the timer runs out, the test ends automatically.

#End Test:

If the user finishes typing the text or the timer reaches 0, the test stops.
The app displays WPM and accuracy based on the actual time taken.
Reset Test:

Clicking Reset Test clears the results and prepares the app for a new test.
